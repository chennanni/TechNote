# Week 1 - Introduction

## What is Machine Learning

Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

Example
- Database mining
  - Large datasets from growth of automation/web, web click data, medical records, biology, engineering
- Applications canâ€™t program by hand.
  - Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Self-customizing programs
  - Amazon, Netflix product recommendations

## Supervised Learning

Know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Two types
- Regression: predict continuous valued output (price)
- Classification: discrete valued output (0 or 1)

## Unsupervised Learning

Approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like.

# Week 1 - Model and Cost Function

## Model Representation

build a mathematic model to represent the real problem

Example: y(x)=ax+b

## Cost Function

a way to evaluate the distance between estimate and real values

# Week 1 - Parameter Learning

## Gradient Descent

Have cost function: J(s0,s1), want to get min(J) -> keep change s0,s1 to achive the local minimum.
